a. how you tested your solution
- import the java project into eclipse
- run the testGenerate.java code if you want to generate random rules, however, the file test.csv contains the default rule examples given in the problem prompt.
- run the Firewall.java to get the reuslts

b. any interesting coding, design, or algorithmic choices you’d like to point out 
- used a hashmap to limit the nu,ber of entries possible and appended multiple entries with same key value to araylist for search ease
- splitted up range and non range to make it simple to understand

c. any refinements or optimizations that you would’ve implemented if you had more time
- figure out how to make search and verification of port and ip address values more efficient in space and runtime

d. anything else you’d like the reviewer to know
- throughly enjoyed creating a base version and improving it from there
